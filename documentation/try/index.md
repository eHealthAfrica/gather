# Try Aether For Yourself

Aether is a platform. This means it only makes sense to use it in the context of creating a solution. For this initial run-through, we’re going to take some raw json input data and create some mappings to transform it into a more useable state. 

In the next step, we'll see how that data can then be fed through to Elastic Search by using Aether Connect, but first things first...

If you want to see how this example works with data coming in from ODK Collect, take a look at this Gather run-through.

We’ve created an `aether-bootstrap` repository to make it easy for you to get up and running with your first Aether-based solution. This contains a bunch of `docker-compose` files that will pull Docker images of the latest version of Aether from Docker Hub and start them up. 

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this run-through, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.

You will also need to register some domains for local resolution on your computer. This means editing your hosts file. On Mac/Linux this is at `/etc/hosts`; on Windows it’s at `...`. Add this line to the bottom:

`127.0.0.1       ui.aether.local kernel.aether.local`

## Into the Aether

Start by cloning this repository to your computer:

`git clone git@github.com:eHealthAfrica/aether-bootstrap.git`
`cd aether-bootstrap`

Now you just need to tell Docker to download the images and start them up:

`docker-compose up`

Once the console output has stopped, you should be able to access the Aether UI in your browser. Use these credentials to log in:

Username: **admin-ui**
Password: **adminadmin**
