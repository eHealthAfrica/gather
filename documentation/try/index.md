# Try Gather For Yourself

The best way to evaluate Gather is to take it for a test drive.  This series of self guided demos will take you through installation, setting up a simple survey and then sending that data to a CKAN data portal.  

## Prerequisites
These setup instructions assume that you are a System's Administrator, Developer or DevOps type person with some familiarity with github and docker.  If this is not you, maybe you can borrow someone like this to help with the prerequisites and get your machine configured properly.  Once your machine is set up and configured with github and docker, the rest is just following command line instructions.

You will need a computer running Linux, macOS, a cloud based Linux VM (such as AWS) or Windows 10 Pro.  A minimum of 8GB of RAM is also required.  These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.x, Mac 10.13.x and Windows 10 Pro (1607).

- GitHub
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed and available
- Docker
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed setup with at least 3GB limit
- The following ports should be available on your machine:  
80, 8000, 8004, 8443, 5000

## Setup Help
If you are unsure what all of the above means, we have some detailed steps that you can follow to get your computer configured to run these demos.  You will need an Intel based 64-bit computer with at least 8GB RAM.

**[Amazon Web Services](http://aether.ehealthafrica.org/documentation/try/setup-aws)** is a great way to evaluate Gather without having to install anything on your own computer.  From start to finish, it only takes about an hour to spin up an EC2 instance, configure it and try the following exercises.  This link will take you to a set of instructions that will help you (even if you are a beginner) get started with AWS and configured to run Gather.  It costs about $3.00 to start up an AWS EC2 instance and run it for 12 hours.
