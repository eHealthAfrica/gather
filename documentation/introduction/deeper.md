# A Deeper Dive

This document should be targeted at a developer or DevOps person and describe the architecture in enough detail to to allow that person to determine if Aether is right for their project.  Talk about:

- Django and how we use it
- Kafka
- Postgres
- Kong (if applicable) (not in initial release)
- Security models
- Kubernetes
- Other tech?
