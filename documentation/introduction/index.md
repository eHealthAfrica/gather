# What Is Gather?

Gather is a versatile, secure and performant platform for data collection. It can be used with existing data collection tools such as ODK Collect, and be extended with a wide range of functionality to ensure data integrity and interoperability.  It provides easy deployment in a secure server or cloud environment and allows administrators to control which data fields can be exported. Gather is built on top of the Aether platform and will eventually inherit the data extraction, masking and publishing capabilities.

It contains a set of tools for creating surveys and collecting data. It is analogous to ODK, and includes components that allow it to function with elements of the ODK ecosystem, such as XLSForms and ODK Collect.
